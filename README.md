# Linux Rice Setup

Personal linux rice setup. Btw I use Arch.

This is technically a guide for a fresh installation of Arch Linux. I dual-booted Arch on my Windows, and at any time we're having trouble with installing, refer to the great [Arch Linux Installation Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide) for help. Without further ado, let's start installing.

## Preparation
What you need to prepare is making sure you're able to access your BIOS (or UEFI) settings. Most systems use F2, F10, or F12 while booting up to access the BIOS/UEFI settings page, but you can also hold Shift while pressing restart to reach this menu.

Another important thing is either an USB drive or a CD/DVD (I'd prefer an USB drive). This will be our installation medium. While it's also possible to install without an USB drive, this is not something we'd go deeply into right now.

Optionally, before installing Arch Linux, please create a recovery drive using a spare USB in case anything happens.

## Download an Installation image
The ISO file that we need to install Arch is available [here](https://archlinux.org/download/). Either download via BitTorrent or through the different available from your desired countries.

It's optional, but you can also verify the image signature to ensure the integrity of the file. You can download gpg to do it.
